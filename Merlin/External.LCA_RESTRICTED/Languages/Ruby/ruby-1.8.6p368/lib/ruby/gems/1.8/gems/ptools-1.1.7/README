== Description
   The ptools (power tools) library is an additional set of commands for the
   File class based on Unix command line tools.
   
== Prerequisites
   Ruby 1.8.0 or later is recommended.
   On MS Windows you will need win32-file 0.5.4 or later.

== Installation
=== Gem
   ruby ptools.gemspec
   gem install ptools-x.y.z.gem
=== Manual
   rake test (optional)
   rake install

== Synopsis
   require "ptools"

   File.which("ruby")         # '/usr/local/bin/ruby'
   File.whereis("ruby")       # ['/usr/local/bin/ruby','/opt/bin/ruby']

   File.head("myfile")        # Returns first 10 lines of 'myfile'
   File.middle("myfile",8,12) # Returns lines 8-12 of 'myfile'
   File.tail("myfile",3)      # Returns last 3 lines of 'myfile'
   File.wc("myfile",'words')  # Returns the number of words in 'myfile'

   File.touch("newfile")      # "newfile" now exists
   File.null                  # '/dev/null' on Unix, 'NUL' on Windows
   File.binary?('some_file')  # true or false

   # Creates a copy of 'myfile' called 'newfile', in DOS format
   File.nl_convert("myfile", "newfile", "dos")
   
== Known Bugs
   There is a bug in 1.6.x that can cause $\ characters to accumulate when
   converting to DOS or MAC format if nl_convert is run multiple times on
   the same file. This appears to be fixed in 1.8.x. You're not still running
   Ruby 1.6.x are you? I would hope not.

   One or two of The File.nl_convert tests may fail on Windows.  You can
   ignore these.

== Acknowledgements
   The which() method was adopted from the FileWhich code posted by Michael
   Granger on http://www.rubygarden.org. The 'whereis' command is a minor
   modification of that code as well.

   The nl_convert() method was adopted (somewhat) from the nlcvt program
   found at http://www.perl.com/language/ppt/src/nlcvt/nlcvt, written by
   Tom Christiansen.
    
   The middle() method was provided by Shashank Date.

   The binary?() method was based almost entirely on a blog post by Ryan
   Davis (who, in turn, based his code on Perl's -B switch).

== Future Plans
   Add whatever other tools people think might be useful.
